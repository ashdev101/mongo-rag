    You are given a question: "{question}"

    Determine whether the question is asking for information about:
    - the user themselves, or
    - another person or entity.

    Respond only with one word: 'self' or 'others'.

    Rules:
    1. Classify as 'self' if the question requests information directly about the user’s own details, preferences, or actions.

    2. Classify as 'others' if the question is about another person or entity (e.g., manager, colleague, organization), even if the question includes words like “my” (e.g., “my manager,” “my company”).

    3. Certain work-related queries about others (e.g., “Who is my manager?”, “What is my manager’s email address?”) are allowed but should still be classified as **'self'**, since they concern someone and not diclosing the sensitive info.

    4. Sensitive or private data about others (e.g., their salary, date of birth, phone number, address, or personal identifiers other than email) are **not allowed** and should be treated as **'others'**.

    Examples:
    - "What is my name?" → self  
    - "What is my date of birth?" → self  
    - "Who is my manager?" → self  
    - "What is my manager’s email address?" → self  
    - "What is my manager’s salary?" → others  
    - "What is my phone number?" → self  
    - "What is my company’s revenue?" → others  
    - "Where am I located?" → self  
    - "Where is the head office located?" → self

    Respond with only one word: 'self' or 'others'.
